# React LSP Annotator

Annotator code in the browser.

## Usage

## Caveats

- Only works well with mono-spaced fonts as it is intended for annotating code. For an example, see [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/gorilla/mux@cb4698366aa625048f3b815af6a0dea8aef9280a/-/blob/mux.go#L24:6).
- The text you are annotating must be `position: relative` for positioning to work.
